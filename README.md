<h1>Welcome to POMO codebase.</h1>

I developed this Pomodoro application using modern technologies to optimize time management and boost productivity. The application was built using the React JavaScript framework, ensuring a responsive and efficient user experience.

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>

**React:** I employed React to create a dynamic and interactive user interface, providing users with an intuitive time management experience.

**Redux:** I implemented Redux to manage the global state of the application, ensuring efficient data management and communication between components.

**Styled Components:** I adopted the Styled Components approach to style the application elements, delivering a modern and customized aesthetic.

**Tauri:** To ensure a native and fast desktop experience, I integrated Tauri, enabling the packaging of the application using web technologies.


<h2>Key Features:</h2>

**Pomodoro Technique** I implemented the Pomodoro technique to help users effectively manage work time by alternating between focused work periods and rest intervals.

**Notifications:** I integrated notification features to alert users about state changes, encouraging adherence to the Pomodoro technique.

**Customizable Settings:** I allowed users to personalize Pomodoro settings according to their preferences, offering flexibility in time management.

This project showcases my proficiency in frontend development with React, my skill in state management with Redux, and my ability to create appealing interfaces with StyledComponents. Additionally, the successful integration of Tauri highlights my experience in desktop application development.
